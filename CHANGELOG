## 4.0.1

## 4.0.0

This major release makes spark-redshift compatible with spark 2.4. This was tested in production.

While upgrading the package we droped some features due to time constraints.

- Support for hadoop 1.x has been dropped.
- STS and IAM authentication support has been dropped.
- postgresql driver tests are inactive.
- SaveMode tests (or functionality?) are broken. This is a bit scary but I'm not sure we use the functionality
 and fixing them didn't make it in this version (spark-snowflake removed them too).
- S3Native has been deprecated. We created an InMemoryS3AFileSystem to test S3A.

## 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT
- SNAPSHOT version to test publishing to Maven Central.

## 4.0.0-preview20190730 (2019-07-30)

- The library is tested in production using spark2.4
- RedshiftSourceSuite is again among the scala test suites.

## 4.0.0-preview20190715 (2019-07-15)

Move to pre-4.0.0 'preview' releases rather than SNAPSHOT

## 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT-20190710 (2019-07-10)

Remove AWSCredentialsInUriIntegrationSuite test and require s3a path in CrossRegionIntegrationSuite.scala

## 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT-20190627 (2019-06-27)

Baseline SNAPSHOT version working with 2.4

#### Deprecation
In order to get this baseline snapshot out, we dropped some features and package versions, 
and disabled some tests.
Some of these changes are temporary, others - such as dropping hadoop 1.x - are meant to stay.

Our intent is to do the best job possible supporting the minimal set of features
 that the community needs. Other non-essential features may be dropped before the
  first non-snapshot release. 
  The community's feedback and contributions are vitally important.


* Support for hadoop 1.x has been dropped.
* STS and IAM authentication support has been dropped (so are tests).
* postgresql driver tests are inactive.
* SaveMode tests (or functionality?) are broken. This is a bit scarier but I'm not sure we use the functionality and fixing them didn't make it in this version (spark-snowflake removed them too).
* S3Native has been deprecated. It's our intention to phase it out from this repo. The test util ‘inMemoryFilesystem’ is not present anymore so an entire test suite RedshiftSourceSuite lost its major mock object and I had to remove it. We plan to re-write it using s3a.
